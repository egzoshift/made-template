# MADE: The evolution of esports into a profession over the last ten years

## MADE - Methods of Advanced Data Engineering
This repository consists of a few exercises and a project that got created during the course of **Methods of Advanced Data Engineering** in winter semester 2023/2024 at FAU (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg).

## Project: The evolution of esports into a profession over the last ten years
As a help to come up with the project, my questions and the analysis at the end I had 2 datasets:
First one contained info about the last 2000 CS:GO tournaments which is a big game when it comes to the esports scene 
and the second one contained more general info such as cash prizes distributed in various esports events from 1998 to 2023

The questions for this project are:  
    (1) How much prize pool for the top 50 games? After I'll compare that to traditional sport leagues and trying to figure out why these games are at the top?
    (2) Is there a strong correlation between genre and prize pool?
    (3) How has the prize pool for the game CS:GO changed over the last three years?


The report is about way more and explains my entire project more in-depth.

## Exercises
Exercises were submitted during the couse and stored within the *exercise* folder.
These exercises were implemented in python or jayvee as an introduction to the project development.
